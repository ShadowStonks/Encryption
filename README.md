# Encryption

## About

My code is quite messy and relatively inefficient, but it does the trick, you can Encrypt, Decrypt and output both the Encypted and Decrypted message which the user enters.

## How the Encryption works

If you want to encrypt data, you are asked to input a string, the string is first converted to ascii codes, each ascii code then has a series of fairly basic calculations done to it, the value after the calculations is then rounded, the value is then converted to hexadecimal, and then to binary. The binary value then has four 1's appended to the front of it, this binary value is then output to a text file.

## How the Decryption works
